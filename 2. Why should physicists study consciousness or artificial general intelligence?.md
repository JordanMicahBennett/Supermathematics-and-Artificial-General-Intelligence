Why should physicists study consciousness/artificial general intelligence?
=====

This answer concerns a discussion about why physicists need to study consciousness, and probably involve themselves in the development of [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence), which is often underlined as [mankind’s likely last invention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9snY7lhJA4c).

Firstly, below is a scintillating talk on [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) given by, Theoretical Physics PHD, and former [Dwave](https://www.dwavesys.com/home) CTO, [Geordie Rose](http://www.ideacity.ca/speaker/geordie-rose/).

He [left Dwave](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/artificial-intelligence/dwave-founder-new-startup-kindred-ai), and is now instead CEO and co-founder of [Kindred Ai](https://www.kindred.ai/).

He gives an entertaining talk in the **tech-vancouver** video below, about why the development of [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) is crucial for mankind.

**Extra**: See also a talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBWc09b6LnM), by [Suzanne Gildert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suzannegildert) (She also left Dwave, to start and head [Kindred Ai](https://www.kindred.ai/). She has a Quantum Physics PHD as well, and used to work on superconducting chips at [Dwave](https://www.dwavesys.com/home))
Secondly, as Max Tegmark expressed [in a youtube video here](https://youtu.be/jXBfXNW6Bxo?t=1977), physicists have long neglected to define the observer in much of the equations. (The observer being the intelligent agent)

**Alert: Notably, when I refer to consciousness below**, I echo Bengio’s words from [one of his recent papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08568), “I do not refer here to more elusive meanings that have been attributed to the word “consciousness” (like qualia (Kriegel, 2014)), sticking instead to the notion of attentive awareness in the moment, our ability to focus on information in our minds which is accessible for verbal report, reasoning, and the control of behaviour.”

As far as science goes, consciousness is likely definable in terms of very complex equations, from disciplines, like Physics; as an example, degrees of general structures such as [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold) central to physics and mathematics, are now [quite prevalent in the study of Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03383).

**Crucial Points:**
=====

As I indicate in the content above, there are two crucial end points:

(1) Physics intends to describe the cosmos, and as Max Tegmark mentions, a non trivial portion of physics, namely the observer has long eluded physics, and so the observer’s framework/consciousness **(as described in the alert above) **warrants non-trivial analysis/development.

(2) Understanding consciousness **(as described in the alert above)**, may lend large help to the development of [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence), which is often underlined as [mankind’s last invention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9snY7lhJA4c), that apart from solving many human problems, (i.e. [Self-taught artificial intelligence beats doctors at predicting heart attacks](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/self-taught-artificial-intelligence-beats-doctors-predicting-heart-attacks)) may also aid in the development of physics. (i.e. [Ai learns and recreates Nobel-winning physics experiment](https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/16/ai-learns-and-recreates-nobel-winning-physics-experiment/))

Consideration/Summary
=====

Although Max Tegmark could be wrong on this; I may not research directly more on the matter of consciousness’ requirements in physics, but [instead physics’ requirement in developing artificial consciousness](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08225), i.e. I shall focus on striving to contribute to the development of [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence), which is probably guaranteed to be a type of meta solution to much of humanity’s issues, including [illness diagnosis](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/self-taught-artificial-intelligence-beats-doctors-predicting-heart-attacks) or [medicine development](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1701/1701.04503.pdf) and the [advancement of the rate of physics experimentation](https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/16/ai-learns-and-recreates-nobel-winning-physics-experiment/) …
