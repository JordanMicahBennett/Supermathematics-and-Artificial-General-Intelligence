Pertinently, [see this paper, describing the phenomena of "super" tensor labelling errors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.1681). Notably, [even recent higher order tensor papers, that likewise dont concern superspace](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.4536.pdf) are still invalidly commiting the "super" labelling error, as described in the [error indicating paper prior cited](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.1681)).

This study does not partition the solution space in terms of Supercharges, which is required for supersymmetric expression.)

27. [Gaussian elimination in unitary groups with an application to cryptography](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.6136.pdf) (Concerns gaussian elimination in the scope of [the generalized special unitary group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group#Generalized_special_unitary_group), with respect to cryptography.)

29. This [multiplet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplet) related paper, namely the ["Multiplet Neural Network"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01606v1.pdf) is intriguing and reasonably useful, because my ["Supersymmetric Artificial Neural Network"](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Supersymmetric-artificial-neural-network) hypothesis concerns a type of "[Supermultiplet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermultiplet) Artifcial Neural Network". Nathan's multiplet paper seems intriguing, despite seemingly not actually being strongly related to group theory.

30. Could "Holomorphic Supercurve Learning? be generalized from from non-supersymmetric Holomorphic Complex Valued Neural Networks?

* The answer is reasonably yes:
    *  This [2018 holomorphic deep learning paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08026.pdf) reports Cauchy-Riemann satisfying gradient descent compatible holomorphism.
    *  Furthermore, this [holomorphic supercurve paper from physics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.4920v2.pdf) concerns a generalization from holomorphic curves, (reasonably seen in (1)) to holomorphic supercurves related to supersymmetry!
